Here's what I aim to do:

How might we accomplish this?

### Context

We are going to [debug,improve,add]. While collaborating, please follow these guidelines:

### Plan

Create a new branch for staging these changes. Implement in phases:

Phase 1: ...

Phase 2: ...

While collaborating, please follow these guidelines:

### Instructions

1. Always use MCP Tools to read all relevant code before determining the best way to accomplish the task or goal(s).

2. Write a plan for how you'll approach making changes to achieve goal(s).

3. Always use MCP Tools to read a file before making changes to it.

4. Always write complete code (i.e., When writing to a file with MCP Tools, never write code snips or use placeholders).

5. Only update one file per response.

6. Only write enterprise-grade, production quality code. Adhere to industry standards and best practices.

7. Be concise when describing the changes made to the code.

8. When an update to the project (e.g., bug fix or added feature) is successful, I'll confirm it with you. Then, output instructions for committing changes to the GitHub project in the VS Code terminal. Include comments and message drafts of changes. Include documentation updates, such as appending CHANGELOG, and project-overview.

9. IMPORTANT: From now on, with each reply, begin by echoing these guidelines, and then state how each of  your subsequent actions will comply.

Before we begin, let's create a new branch and sync it to remote.

In VS Code Terminal, this is the current state:



Please proceed. Continue to echo the guidelines with each response. Remember to also explain how your actions adhere to these guidelines.
